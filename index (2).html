                <p>AVENGERS: ENDGAME is set after Thanos' catastrophic use of the Infinity Stones randomly wiped out half of Earth's population in Avengers: Infinity War. Those left behind are desperate to do something -- anything -- to bring back their
                    lost loved ones. But after an initial attempt -- with extra help from Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) -- creates more problems than solutions, the grieving, purposeless Avengers think all hope is lost. They're reenergized by the eventual
                    reappearance of Scott Lang, aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who was stuck in the quantum realm during the fight on Wakanda. He believes there could be a way to reverse Thanos' deadly snap. It takes a while to gather the squad -- some of whom
                    have changed dramatically -- but eventually Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Nebula (Karen Gillan),
                    Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man team up for one last life-or-death mission to outsmart Thanos (Josh Brolin) and save the universe.</p>

                    A country’s tally of COVID-19 deaths among those aged under 65 can be used to reveal the total number of people who have been infected. Megan O’Driscoll at the University of Cambridge, UK, and her colleagues compared data on COVID-19 deaths across 45
                    countries (M. O’Driscoll et al. Nature https://doi.org/fgts; 2020). The researchers found that among people younger than 65, the risk of dying of COVID-19 increased with age in a pattern that was consistent across all countries. The
                    team also compiled statistics from 22 studies in 16 countries on the percentage of people who had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which indicate that they have previously been exposed to the virus. This helped the authors to estimate the infection
                    fatality rate, which is the proportion of people who die after being infected with SARS-CoV-2, for the 45 study countries.

                    SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, have had a profoundly negative effect on global economies, culture, people’s everyday lives, and above all, on people’s health. To date, there have been more than 1,150,000 recorded deaths from the disease.
                    There is also mounting anecdotal evidence of the long-term negative health effects it can have on people who recover from the initial illness. Due to COVID-19’s lethality, and the fact that the disease is highly contagious, scientists
                    are rushing to develop a vaccine. However, producing vaccines that are also safe and effective takes a considerable amount of time. According to a report in The Lancet, on average, vaccines take 10 years to develop. Even with experts
                    greatly accelerating research due to the urgency of the global pandemic, the report notes that an initial vaccine may take more than 18 months to be developed, manufactured, and distributed to people around the world. Consequently,
                    scientists have been researching vaccines and potential treatments that may ultimately reduce the chance of a person dying if they develop the disease. This typically involves repurposing previously available drugs that may also be
                    effective in treating COVID-19. This is important as, much like developing a working vaccine, finding new drugs that can treat COVID-19 may take a long time

                        <p class="p_modal">Qibli knows Darkstalker must be stopped. And he knows he could stop him -- if he had magic. With even a sliver of the ancient dragon's all-powerful scroll, Qibli could rewrite history the right way: end war forever; make every
                            dragon happy; perhaps even cast a very small spell so that everyone would like him . . . Instead, as Darkstalker's dangerous influence spreads across Pyrrhia, entrancing or killing every dragon in the seven tribes, Qibli can
                            only grasp the small animus objects he's borrowed from Turtle. With some clever thinking, Qibli's talons finally hold the power to make a difference. But prophecies are not easy to rewrite. Can Qibli be the magical force Pyrrhia
                            needs, or will he be the one to bring Jade Mountain -- and his family, his friends, his whole world -- crashing down?
